VeriFi is on a mission to maximize positive social connections worldwide by 
strengthening the presence of digital communities within the physical world.
Unlike other social media technologies designed to maximize attention, clicks,
searches, or ad revenue, our technology, at its core, prioritizes connecting 
people to their communities, both locally and digitally. We want people to 
explore new towns, join new spaces, share their experiences, and re-discover 
the beautiful world we are blessed to experience every day.
